# Text-adventure
This is a text based adventure game I made
Note: To play the game you need to create a new project in visual studio, drag all the .cs files into it,
Then add the .txt files in your net6.0 of the .csproj you created.
Enjoy!
Also if you can't figure the game out, you can open the walkthrough!
